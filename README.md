# Dear_Diary
This is my 6th semester Web development project with the backend. The purpose of building this project was to explore the concepts of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery and MySQL. All the files have been saved with the .php extension. I had used the XAMPP server for creating my own local server and for the backend, I had used phpMyAdmin along with MySQL.
